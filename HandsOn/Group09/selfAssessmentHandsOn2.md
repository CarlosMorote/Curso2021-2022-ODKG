# Hands-on assignment 2 – Self assessment

## Checklist

- [] An HTML document that includes the analyses performed over the data source and the licensing of the data source, as well as the resource naming strategy defined ("analysis.html" in the root of the group directory).
- [] An OWL file with the ontology developed, according to the resource naming strategy defined, and using the Turtle syntax ("*.ttl" under an "ontology" directory).
- [] An RDF file with a sample instantiation of the ontology, following the resource naming strategy, and using the Turtle syntax (“*-example.ttl” under an "ontology" directory).
- [x] A Markdown document with the hands-on self-assessment (”selfAssessmentHandsOn2.md" in the root of the group directory).

## Tasks

- [] Analyse Data Set. Analyse both the data (quantities, value ranges, etc.) as well as the schema of the data.
- [] Analyse Licensing of the Data Source. Analyse who is the publisher of the dataset and its rightsholder, as well as the licence of the dataset. Define the potential license to be used for the dataset to be generated.
- [] Define Resource Naming Strategy. Define the resource naming strategy to be followed for the ontology and the data to be generated (URI form, content negotiation, URIs domain, path, patterns, etc.).
- [] Develop Ontology. Develop a lightweight ontology that includes the classes and properties (with their domains and ranges) to be used with the dataset. The rest of ontological components (e.g., restrictions) are optional for this assignment.
